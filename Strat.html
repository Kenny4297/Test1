            <h3>Pin</h3>
                
                <p>In chess, a pin is a chess tactic in which a defending piece cannot move without exposing a more valuable defending piece on its other side to capture by the attacking piece. Moving the attacking piece to bring on the pin is called pinning; the defending piece so restricted is described as pinned. Only pieces that can move an indefinite number of squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line (i.e. bishops, rooks, and queens) can pin. Kings, knights, and pawns cannot pin. Any piece can be pinned except the king, since the king must be immediately removed from check under all circumstances. It is like a skewer, but in a skewer, the more valuable piece is the one under direct attack.</p>

                <p class="pic-description">Notice how in the figure above the black knight is being pinned by the white bishop, along with the white knight being pinned by black's rook! If white wanted to, he can still move his knight, but the black rook will pick up white's queen. Notice that it is illegal to move black's knight, since that would put him in check!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box-item">
            <h3>Fork</h3>
                
                <p>In chess, a fork is a tactic in which a piece attacks two or more pieces simultaneously. The attacker usually aims to capture one of the forked pieces, or threaten checkmate. The defender often finds it difficult to counter two or more threats in a single move.</p>

                <p class="pic-description">Notice in the figure above the potential fork the white knight has when it lands in the green square. Black only has one choice: move the kning, and lose his Queen. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box-item">
            <h3>Skewer</h3>
                
                <p>A skewer is when a valuable piece is attacked, and when it moves, a lesser piece is exposed to capture. So, in a sense, the skewer is the inverse of the pin. Unlike forks, only the long range pieces - the bishop, rook and queen, are able to perform pins and skewers.</p>

                <p class="pic-description">Notice in the figure above the danger black is in. If it is black's turn to move, the rook on h3 will be landing on h7. This will check the king, picking up the queen when the king moves. Black should just resign after this - the position is completely lost for black.</p>
